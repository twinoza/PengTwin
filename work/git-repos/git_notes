In order to get solarized working properly in the terminal and vim, you need to run the following commands:

--- Cloning gnome-terminal-colors-solarized ---
First you need to clone gnome-terminal-colors-solarized:
	git clone git://github.com/sigurdga/gnome-terminal-colors-solarized.git
Once you have cloned this directory, you need to set the gnome-terminal to the right colors. You do this by typing:
    $ cd gnome-terminal-colors-solarized
    $ install.sh
	  $ ./solarize  ## OBSOLETE ##

--- Cloning solarized ---
You can/should also clone the full solarized package, just in case you want to set other script.  It is best to do this while you are still in the /work/git-repos directory (here).  To do this, run the following command:
    $ git clone git://github.com/altercation/solarized.git

--- Cloning vim-colors-solarized ---
Now, in order to have vim be colorized properly, you need to clone vim-colors-solarized.  To use pathogen (recommended) you must clone the `vim-colors-solarized` directory so that it is a subdirectory of the `.vim/bundle` directory.  As such, typing the following two commands will achieve this easily and automatically.
    $ cd ~/.vim/bundle
    $ git clone git://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized.git
